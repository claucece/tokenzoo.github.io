## Unforgeability

Also studied [by Hoepman et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/842.pdf) for the
case of multi-show credential schemes.

Studied over [Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/580.pdf), it is
referred to the notion that an adversary should not be able to produce an exact
same valid token (TODO: I guess we should be referring to them as that) that has
been produced in the past.

It is related to what is referred
on [Privacy Pass](https://www.petsymposium.org/2018/files/papers/issue3/popets-2018-0026.pdf)
as 'one-more-token' security: the requirement that a party should be unable to
forge validly signed tokens using information it learns (TODO: learns during what phase?).

## Unlinkability, Blindenss

Defined here [by Camenisch et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/580.pdf) as a
property of a signature scheme, in the sense that the issuance of a token
(TODO: or signature, might be the same..) and its later use in a protocol
cannot be linked.

It is also referred as 'context-hiding', in earliest [works](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/179.pdf)
Also studied [by Hoepman et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/842.pdf) for the case of multi-show credential schemes.

## Strong-unlinkability

An anonymous credential scheme where linking the token to a user is protected
by information-theoretic means, and not just computational security.

## Revocation

Defined here by [Acar et al.](https://www.iacr.org/archive/pkc2011/65710436/65710436.pdf) and
implemented using an accumulator scheme with delegatable non-membership proofs

Revocation can also be achieved with TODO

## Single/Multi-show

Related terms: "self-blindable"


## Public Verifiability

An attribute-based credential (ABC) scheme allows a user, given a set of
attributes, toprove ownership of these attributes to a verifer and selectively
disclose some of them whilekeeping the others secret

## Delegatable

In a delegatable anonymous credential system, participants may use their
credentials anonymously as well as anonymously delegate them to other
participants.

Introduced in [CL06]({{site.baseurl}}/schemes.html#cl06).

## Escrow



## Threshold Issuance

A credential scheme where there can be multiple credential issuers which can
also potentially be Byzantine. (see [Coconut](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07344.pdf)).
